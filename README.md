NLTK-Text-Corpora.ipynb
Covers:
1- Loading the nltk.corpus corpora.
2- Using corpus.raw corpus.words corpus.sentence for tokenizing and counting.
3- Using the corpus as string, or tokens list.

4- Tokenizing a raw string using split()
	Note: Doesn't work well. e.g. can't extract the ponctuations like "I asked her: how are you?"  >>> gives ...[her:],...,[you?]
5- Tokenizing a raw string using nltk work_tokenize. Gives good results. Can tokenize ponctuations.

6- Creating a text object using Text method from nltk.text package
7- Exploring text for concordance, similarity and common_contexts
